# AdoptionHub
Our project “Adoption Hub” will be a web application for use by foster adoption agencies. The purpose of the project is to allow agencies to manage the pets that are in their system and present them to potential adopters.  

## Features 
The following features will make up the core functionality of the application: 
- Two login portals, one for backend users and one for frontend users. 
- A backend dashboard which allows administrators to add pets and fosters to edit information about the pets. 
- A front end which displays pets to potential adopters and allows them to contact the foster agency.
